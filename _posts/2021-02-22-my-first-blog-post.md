Tech Mining: Practical approach to exploit science and technology (S&T) information resources
The tech mining approach has 3 key elements:
* Data: acquired from  R&D publications (Science Citation Index, INSPEC, MEDLINE) and patent abstract databases (Derwent World Patent Index, Delphion)
* Software from search and retrieval, through cleaning and analysis, to representation and visualization. Tools: Vantage Point
* Technology Intelligent product: the outputs of the empirical analyses target the intended usersâ€™ information needs
Tech mining starts with management needs. Some of such issues are:
-  R&D portfolio selection
-  R&D project initiation
-  Engineering project initiation
-  New product development etc.
